csmeg - 2-D game engine/renderer for modern OpenGL rendering 
with shaders

Highly OO designed and extensible architecture and has been
worked on  Linux and Windows. Whole design and implementation
was done from scratch with no references to other rendering
engines.

Supports rendering of 2D sprites with rotation. See 
CTesterGame.cpp for usage for now.

Current state:
This is a project which has been on hold for many years now. 
When I ran the executable on Linux (Ubuntu 18) the rendering 
does not display anything for some reason. 
It was working when I put the project on hold. I haven't yet
tried under Windows yet. In the coming future I try to fix
this to make the rendering actually display something again! :-)

Testing was done mainly with the 'tester' application.

Compiles but the rendering has broken atleast on my current 
Ubuntu 18 system. On Linux it can be built using 'scons'
in the main directory of the project. Depends on boost and 
SOIL libraries as well as SGL, GL and GLEW.

*** This is a serious work in progress ***
